Bluetooth connection was strong and problem-free, and the wear sensors seem to work exactly as advertised. Being able to turn off / adjust noise canceling is a welcome feature. USB-C charging is awesome. However, there were a few deal breakers that have pushed me to return them.\\n\\n-Uncomfortable to wear. The ear cushions are more like thin rims around the earcups, and the clamping pressure is high, so they really dig into your skin. Additionally, a pressure point/hotspot begins to develop at the very top of your head where all of the weight seems to be centered. No amount of break-in brought these to an acceptable level. The headphones are some of the heaviest in their class, and so it makes it very difficult to have multi-hour listening sessions.\\n\\n-A significantly more \"neutral\" sound than earlier B&W products. They don\\'t have as much of a warm, bassy V-shaped sound signature as earlier headphones like the P7 wireless. Depending on your music preferences, that could be a good or bad thing. Since my music is generally hip hop and R&B, this was a con.\\n\\n-No passive listening support. You cannot connect these to a standard aux cable and just have them play like a typical wired headset. They must be powered, and that means you will have to replace the battery at some point down the line. B&W doesn\\'t give any information about battery replacement costs and logistics on their website, which is a little annoying. I want to know what system is in place to service these things in the long run.\\n\\n-Questionable customer service? I emailed a question to their tech support over a week ago and was sent an auto-response promising a reply within two days. Never got one.',\n",

To me, the build quality on them is one of their shining qualities, along with stunning sound at a nice price point. I am an audiophile and have found these to be perfect complement to my Ker r700's at home.\\n\\nMuch to my disappointment, I recently pulled my headphones out of my case to see the frame has snapped, leaving the right ear to be flopping about, unable to create a proper seal with my ear. All this with diligent case use, and very proper treatment over less than a year. I am not sure if this is an anomaly, but it is shocking and disappointing to say the least.\\n\\nWhat's worse is the support, I have called the number via their North America line and have gotten an answering machine. This does not give me much faith that B+W will be willing or able to help remedy this build quality fault. Will update this post once/if I hear back about how they resolve this.\\n\",\n",

I am a classical music person, and I have a very high-end system, as well as high-end Sennheiser headphones; I am particular about quality of sound - and these are superb: full, good spatial differentiation, nicely balanced bass, beautifully made and beautiful to look at, convenient and intelligent controls - I hate to say it, after years of Sennheisers, but these sound better to my ear. But: I find them very uncomfortable to wear for any prolonged period: the rather narrow head band simply pressed too hard and gives me a bad headache: better weight distribution is needed. Badly.\\n\\nSo: 5 stars on sound and usability , and a reluctant 2 or even 1 star on comfort, though I admit that my head is sensitive to this kind of pressure, though it may well not effect others the same way.',\n",

The sound is great, but a few months after purchasing them — and enjoying their great sound — they broke leaving me without them. It was difficult to reach customer support as they have limited ours, and mostly you reach their answering machine. Eventually B&W customer support derived me to the nearest dealer, which sent a refurbished headphone (I was fine with this). Not too long, the lower volume button gets stuck, and this causes malfunction of the headset. Volume lowers by itself, and it appears that this also prevents the auto-wake up function. As a result, the headphones are almost but useless. I have written a few emails back to customer support only to wait with no answer. In summary, customer support is mediocre at best, reliability is poor, and Bluetooth pairing is complicated. I‘d stay away, as nice looking and good sounding as they are.',\n",

I have to say, prior to purchase I had serious concerns about user comfort based on prior reviews. However, after extensive use I’m pleased to say I have experienced zero discomfort. They don’t clamp onto your head too tightly – to the point that if you lean over to tie a shoe they might start to slip off. The top band is also comfortable, and has never bothered me even during 6 hour flights. I think these are great headphones. I love that they pause the music when removed, and the ability to tweak the noise cancelling to maximize sound quality (whether of the music or to reduce background noise) is great. If you are on the fence due to comfort concerns raised in other reviews, I’m happy to say that my experience has been great and I’m pleased with my purchase.',\n",

The comfort was horrible and sound was not too far behind it.\\nNow, after a good week of wearing them for about 2hrs a day they did get more comfortable and sound has gotten good. After a month of listening they became my favorite headphones I have ever owned! Now fast forward to today and they feel great and sound amazing, bass is not over powering, but tight, mids are very clean and a little forward (which I like) highs are clean as well just not as forward as the mids. Overall I love the sound, those headphones are not for bass heads, I'd say they are more on the neutral sound.\\nHave to keep in mind that they sound best with high quality music, when playing songs of lower quality they sound just that.\\nBuild quality is out of this world! Nothing can comes close.\\nUses USB C which others don't, this was a big deal for me.\\nBattery life is amazing.\\nNoise canceling is great in flight mode, but sound takes a great hit. In office mode they sound best, but not as much noise canceling.\\nOverall now for me they get 5 stars, I think B&W should make it very clear that those headphones need time to break-in.\",\n",
              "       'Amazing! I researched and comparison shopped for about 4 months. Read review after review. Went to a certain brick and mortar electronics store to try headphones on and I finally decided to get these despite some less than favorable reviews. Sure there were some sure bet headphones like the Bose and Sonys. But I didn\\'t want what everyone else had. As a train commuter, I took note of what headphones other commuters were wearing and decided I didn\\'t want to look like everyone else. If I was going to spend this much money on a pair of headphones, I wanted them to stand out and look like they cost this much! And this was confirmed when I opened the package upon receiving the headphones and my wife says \"wow, those look like $400 headphones\". I knew I had made the right decision.\\nWith regards to sound cancelling and comfort (the two biggest things people complained about these headphones)... All I can say is I am enjoying my music more than I ever have, I can hear more of my music and hear a lot less of my surroundings. I generally wear these for 2 hours at a time with the commute and while I notice them on my head, I find that they are very comfortable! They feel like quality, they sound like quality and when I\\'m wearing them, I feel like I\\'ve a stylish accessory that is also highly functional on my head.\\nNo one can tell you which headphones to get and some might be better than others in some areas, but there is no one perfect set. Having said that, the BW PXs, for me, come pretty darn close to perfection!',\n",
              "       \"ONE STAR only because I cannot award ZERO STARS. Audio was fair (best in class - for the tincan and string category), but the cheap materials, poor design and exceptionally useless 'help' desk make these about as worthless as a pair of beats. After a few months of normal use, both earpieces snapped at the exact same contact point on the headband. B&W's online service support is a labrynth fitting Ancient Greek mythology. Several hours calling, getting automatically disconnected, and, after two days, finally getting a call back, the individual directed me back to the labrynth. This would not be too bad, except the damned website goes into loops, never acknowledges data input, and, at two weeks since the last attempt, no response contact. Amazon really should dump this garbage provider. These trashphones would be a hard sell at a Dollar General store. Stick with BOSE.

One being that they needed broken in and it hurt the top of your head and that you couldn’t wear glasses with them. Well I can say they fit perfectly. I didn’t get a headache or have to break them in. One thing I don’t press them down onto the top of my head they rest nicely on the top of my head. I wear glasses the arms are on the thin side and I still have a good seal no headache. I have worn them for an hour so far no problems.\\nThe ear pads have a nice cushion no problems no headaches. The style is 5 Star I purchased the navy/gold. The sound is incredible! I have not used them yet on an airplane that will happen at the end of the month. I hope I still have the same opinion after my first flight since that was why I made this purchase. But so far I don’t think I will be disappointed. I love these headphones! This is my first over the ear headphones I have purchased. I’m very happy. The earbuds that I have are Bose that I use at the gym. The only thing I would add is the soft quilted case--disappointed with that .Far the price and quality your paying for these headphones there should be hard sided case for the protection of these headphones. Don't feel this soft quilted bag will protect these headphones while traveling. That is the only negative I have found\",\n",

I figured I'd give them a chance to break in, but after a week it wasn't much better. Then, by chance, I decided to listen to them before sleeping with my glasses off. The sound was totally different, it was amazing. I immediately put my glasses back on and the sound returned to distant. Took my glasses off: amazing. I realized with my glasses on, the earcups don't seal properly at the back and somehow this totally changes the sound. I was so disappointed that I briefly considered contacts, but in the end I decided to return these headphones.

I wanted to see first hand the things mentioned on other reviews regarding tight fitment. I could sit these on my head for about 2 hours before my jaw and the top of my head began to ache. I'm a guy with above average ear size and fit the cup just fine, but my eartips did need to be crunched a little to fit. I really like the appearance, the USB-C connection, and premium durability. However, the other drawbacks makes this set fall short of what I'm hunting for.\",\n",

I tested out a few from Sennheiser to Bose and the PX's provided the best sound and feel of any that I tried.\\n\\nI use these daily, and unfortunately, the headband pad is already pulling out of the metal band (see pictures). My Bose QC15's lasted way longer before showing any material defects (used daily for about 6 years). For a relatively expensive pair of headphones, I'd expect them to last more than a year.\\n\\nOn that, the warranty should kick in for the headband, if you can ever get in touch with Bowers & Wilkins to file for the warranty that is.

However, the sound rendering is very consistent with its counterpart loudspeakers. The bass is smooth, accurate but unlike those boomy stuff which I hate so much... mid is snappy and clean. High is very clean but a tiny bit harsh on vocal when it goes louder, volume it down a little fixes it. The fatiguing level is low which I'm very surprised... I wear it when working, listen to my collection at mid volume level -- I'm lovin' it.

              "       'Just got these headphones not too long ago. Overall they are pretty good. Craftsmanship and material quality is very good. The padding for the ears is held on magnetically, so they can be replaced when worn out, which is great. My only minor gripe is they are a bit stiff comfort wise. I had the beats wireless headphones before, which seem a bit more comfortable. Not to say these are uncomfortable, they are just a bit \"stiff\". Also i have pretty big ears and after wearing headphones for hours they do hurt a little, but i\\'ve find that to be the case with almost all headphones. Battery life is pretty dang amazing. After initial charge i\\'ve been wearing them for almost nonstop for days without needing a charge, it\\'s pretty amazing. Also i\\'ve heard people complaining about the feature where it pauses whatever you\\'re listening to when you pop the headphones off, people saying it doesn\\'t work that great. Well i gotta say it works great for me, also you have some adjustments sensitivity wise with this feature. So maybe the other people need to adjust the settings? Great headphones overall.',\n",

Buying some other brand..',\n",
              "       \"I am thoroughly impressed so far.\\nPackaging is simplistic and straight to the point with two peel back tabs that let you inside. From there, you will see the NCH 700's case which was smaller than I thought because they don't fold up like the QC35II's. The case fits in my work bag just fine. However, I do have say it's not as small overall as the QC35II's case. The NCH 700 case has a little magnetic flap inside that stores the audio and USB-C cable. No airplane adapter. Thank you Bose for going USB-C with the NCH 700's. What's left is manuals and warranty cards.\\nThe feel of the NCH 700's is nice. It's a streamlined design that grew on me and looks very modern. Weight is slightly more than the QC35II's. Build quality is significantly superior with more metals being used and most importantly, the comfort is similar. I would maybe give the slight edge to the QC35II in comfort due to the lower weight, but the NCH 700's is still a very comfortable headphone. The headband adjustment is smooth and should accommodate a wide variety of head sizes just fine. Ear-cup openings is similar to the QC35II with the left and right labels inside the ear cups for easy notation on how to put the headphones on.\\nControls are great and I can say the touch controls are very responsive and intuitive. Swipe up for volume increase. Swipe down for volume decrease. Swipe forward for the next track. Swipe backward for the previous track. Double tap to play and pause. Tap once to accept and incoming call. Tap and hold to reject the call. Tap and hold to go to a shortcut predefined in the app. The current shortcut available was to have the voice prompt alert you of the current battery life in which she tells you the estimated time until the battery is dead. There's 3 dedicated buttons on the NCH 700's. The two on the right is responsible for Power on/Bluetooth pairing and voice assistance/mute mic. The one on the left is to cycle between the 3 preset noice cancelling modes defined with the app. The right earpiece houses the USB-C port and the left earpiece houses the audio input port.\\nThe app provides a lot of functionality control. You can on the fly scroll though the noise cancelling/ambient modes from 0-10. 0 being like having no headphones on at all and 10 being in your own little acoustical chamber. You can launch Bose AR apps and experience augmented reality with he NCH 700's. Pretty cool. You can select the sources that are connected and add a new source or remove an existing source. The NCH 700 can connect to up to 2 devices at once. You can set your voice assistant between Siri, Google Assistant or Alexa. You can set how much of your voice is heard during phone calls or voice assistant interaction. If you're familiar with the QC35II's Bose Connect app, it's pretty much similar settings you can control.\\nSound on the NCH 700's is clean, open and balanced when at moderate volumes. No frequency really stands out so you get an accurate representation of your music. I would say they sound similar to the QC35II but with a tighter bass. The Sony WH1000Xm3 in comparison sounds more warm and full with a more engaging and alive presentation similar to being at the concert. The Bose sounds more accurate and clear and more like being in the studio. A flat and accurate sound will not sound exciting to everyone however so do keep that into consideration if you're eyeing the Bose.. Sound is subjective overall so you can't go wrong with what you enjoy listening to. I really enjoy the NCH 700's sound. It's a smooth and clear sound that plays well with all genres. The main issue I have with the Bose NCH 700 sound is that when you want to crank the volume, the bass literally begins to disappear in the mix due to the active EQ implementation from Bose. I personally do not like this as it makes these headphones sound harsh and tinny.\\nNoise cancelling is insanely good on the NCH 700's. The Sony WH1000Xm3 is still a bit more effective at reducing outside noises especially in the midrange and treble frequencies. Unfortunately, both headphones get those distortion artifacts when the ANC pressure within the ear cups is disrupted from sudden vibrations to the headphones. For example this can be caused by being on a bus while on a bumpy road or running with your headphones on. The ambient aware mode is very natural feeling on the NCH 700 and it's great being able to have awareness while listening to audio in situations where you don't want to blocked completely from the world. Would be cool if it had the Sony's right hand palm over the ear cup feature where it seamlessly kicks in ambient sound and lowers the music volume so you can quickly hear someone or something and then once your hand leaves the right ear cup, everything reverts back to normal. The Bose NCH 700 does this with the button on the left ear cup. If you press and hold the button for about 2 seconds, it pauses the music and pipes in the nosies around you. When you press the button again, it reverts back to the previously set ANC setting and resumes playing audio.\\nThe NCH 700's perform exceptionally for voice mic quality on calls and interacting with your voice assistant. It's amazing how clear your voice is projected onto the other line while using the NCH 700. These are killer for conference calls even if you dare take them in the middle of Times Square, NYC.\\nOverall, the NCH 700 is a welcome evolution to the Bose headphone line up and I'm sure these will win the hearts of many. Highly recommended!\",\n",
              "       'I\\'ve owned these for half a day so far and have decided to keep them around. I\\'m an audiophile who spends money on kickstarter earbuds, custom-made preamps, and (in general) quality hardware which reduces my audio experience as little as possible. Trying these cans in-store at BestBuy allowed me to appreciate the hardware quality of the exterior... quality matte plastic moulding, amazing comfortable faux-leather surfaces on your skin, and a synthesized voice and audible feedback to assist with your navigation of the three hardware buttons and touch controls make these headphones easy to wear during work sessions, public transit commutes, or in a crowded home with loud kids. As a brand new product, the tension on the cans over your ears and on your head can become uncomfortable within an hour of use. Subjectively, I don\\'t consider my head to be particularly large or larger-than-average and will need to play around with adjusting the cups to sit lower or higher on the band which also release/tighten the tension respectively to see if this becomes a long term problem with use. Taking short breaks with the headphones off (10-15 minutes) helps and gives a good excuse/reminder to take a break from work to relax the body/eyes/ears.\\nThe sound quality is reasonable for the headphones. When using the headphones with noise cancellation off, ambient noise seems to lack a very strong low end frequency response (sub ~250Hz, not measured) and might reduce your meatspace experience in some cases where mixed ambient and input audio are desired. That said, direct input still seems to perform quite well with solid frequency response all around which lets the very highs and very lows to be pretty well-balanced.\\nA test using the headset for phone conversation over bluetooth yielded very nice results. The setup involved the cans paired with my laptop streaming music and my Project Fi Pixel 3 phone on standby. Using the Google voice assistant to start the call resulted in some clumsy voice detection/understanding problems (\"I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t get that, who would you like to call? I don\\'t know that name, who would you like to call? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Dialing...\" _sigh_) which I don\\'t believe are the fault of the cans at all. The test included loud ambient music in the room with the person wearing the headphones and found the other user to experience practically none of the ambient noise through the call with a very clear bead on the callee\\'s voice despite close proximity to the music source playing at a moderate volume (such that the ambient music was leaking through the room walls and making it hard to isolate whether the headphones were leaking the ambient noise into the call...which it seemed _not_ to do with this casual test setup). Noticeable was the (300-700ms) delay from the user on the headphones which seemed to not be present from the non-headphone user. It was hardly a concern and either due to the latency in the network transmitting the audio (which, again, was a local wifi call between handsets.... though I am unsure if the handsets route audio locally or not) or possibly in the audio processing from the headset. This latency was par for most mobile calls and should be completely unnoticeable in a remote environment when you\\'re not there to hear to source before the transmitted audio through the headset.\\nA few gripes about the design and ergonomics of the device:\\n- the button placement: very easy to accidentally active these buttons which adjusting the placement of these cans if not aware/careful.\\n- the direction of earcup rotation: when placing the cans around the neck/shoulders, the earcups rotate up (into the air) rather than down (onto your chest). Questionable choice here as it makes the headphones somewhat uncomfortable to hold there, but perhaps Bose never expects you to remove the phones... unsure if that\\'s a reasonable expectation or not.\\n- the synthetic leather matte black surface inside the top of the headset and on the earcups attract oil and will certainly show for those of us with that sort of skin. This may require some extra TLC and upkeep to keep as pristine as one might like. The white set might fair better in this regard.\\nOverall summary:\\nA pricey purchase that I would have trouble justifying as a personal expense (these were expensed by my employer and intended for daily voice conference usage and isolation during work hours in busy coffee shops) and really comes down to the longevity of the product over time. If these headphones end up lasting me longer than 5 years, I would be VERY satisfied with the purchase. At a price point closer to $250-300, this would be a much easier personal purchase to make.\\nAs a user which \"babies\" their hardware, I am eager to see whether this will stand the test of time. Direct input (from a bluetooth source that is not ambient noise) has a very solid frequency response which does not noticeably detract from the music experience. Longterm use may be uncomfortable depending on your head size. The noise cancellation works wonderfully and almost too well, leaving me at a \"5\" setting more often than a \"10\" as complete cancellation feels too isolating and uncomfortable to feeling the lack of \"air\" around me. BLE connection to multiple devices (two) at once allows for seemless transitions between either input. This is also a first time purchase of a Bose product. Looking forward to seeing how the device matures and support is handled over time. Firmware updates are provided automatically to the headset through their app. Battery life \"appears\" long but I have yet to complete a full discharge cycle to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find the phones report +5 hours of use remaining at 20% battery charge and +20 hours at full charge (the audio assistant delivers the charge level as \"hours of use\" remaining, not battery level...which is still viewable in the Bose Music app. Nice touch, Bose).',\n",

My partner has the QC35 II, so I used that unit for comparison.\\nSetup:\\nI did have to wait a little bit for the device to be detected during pairing on my iPhone XS, but it eventually connected, activated, and noted that there was an update. I let it finish up with the update, which took about 20 minutes.\\nSound:\\nSo, I did adjust the EQ just a tiny bit to raise the bass in Spotify, but I did the same on my QC35s. Now, I did raise them just a little more on these, so the other reviewers are right when they say the factory EQ-ing on these is a bit more flat.\\nNow, once I had things tuned just right, I found the sound stage on a song like Charles Bradley's Changes really really impressive on these. I heard an actual stage echo effect from Charles' voice on the right side, something I had never noticed before. The song's stage felt noticeably smaller when I tried listening back on the QC35 II. Beyond Charles Bradley, they handle my varying tastes and genres great.\\nFeel:\\nThey definitely have a little less give on the sides, so some with large heads may feel a little discomfort. I've got a bit of a big head, so I'm still getting used to them, but it's nothing that causes me to take them off. They do seem to transfer heat out of the cavity less than on the QC35s, so it could get a little toasty for some.\\nTech:\\nI love the 10 Step ANC. There is a fade effect when switching between them or fully pausing ANC/Music to hear someone. I found on the QC35s, the audio quality of music dropped when the ANC was reduced, that's not the case here. I felt no drop in audio quality. Haven't tried Alex, but Google Assistant is snappy.\\nThis review is a work in progress and I've had the unit for 4 days, so I'll be back!\",\n",

I understand it's a newer product, and the review sample size is still small, but I was concerned. Four hundred dollars is a fair chunk of coin, and I wanted something I was not going to regret buying.\\nI do not regret my purchase at all. I listened to as many pairs of headphones I could find. The NC700's are not the best sounding pair I listened to,but they do sound very good. I am not going to grow weary of Bose's sound signature anytime soon. They do not sound like the B & W's or the Bang and Olufsen's, but they do not suck. I mostly listen to music that is being streamed and/or compressed anyway. After that, they are far and away the most comfortable headphones I have ever had on my head. I a big guy with a fat head, and they feel awesome for extended periods. They are also an exceptional choice if you wear glasses. That wound up being a fairly important issue, because I tend to work long hours while wearing glasses. The Noise Cancelling is as good as it gets. There is not much else you can say about it. An added bonus for me was the best call quality of any headset I have ever used.\\nSo yeah, buy them.

I had no problems setting these headphones up and running right from the box using the Bose Music App. I set mine up after their first update. I see that today 8-7-19 they have made a second update to the app. These headphones are on par with wired units. I also own a pair of Bowers and Wilkins P7 wired headphones Using a Sony DAC with it. Up until now they were my headphones with superior sound. These Bose headphone match it. I also have the Bose Soundlink II headphones. They are lighter than this unit but no noise counseling. I really like this new design. Bose put some thought into this unit with design and quality. No more of that fabric material on the headband that disenegrates over time. The ear cup material is soft and appears sturdier too. They function well. The app is not perfect but adequate at this time. I haven't had time to test the second update. They really need to add an equalizer to the app with presets and customization like the Sony units. The unit has crystal clear highs, very good midrange and decent bass. The noise cancelling is great. I think the app will get better and better. So at this point I am very pleased with them. As a note, the luxe silver is beautiful but the black will probably look better aesthetically in the long run from showing normal wear marks.\",\n",

From there I paired them with my Surface Pro and desktop PC both with Windows 10 and they work great with both. I had no problems switching between either PC and the phone, just had to pause playback on one and start it on another. So far the only problem I’ve found is the play, forward, and back touch controls don’t work with the pc. The volume touch controls do though, all the touch controls work connected to the phone.The sound from these surprised me a lot after some of the reviews. They sound great, they have plenty of base and are very clear with all the music I’ve played. The ANC works very well, I’m able to still hear voices a little with it on 10 though. It works best with things like motor and AC noise. They are very comfortable to me, I haven’t had any discomfort at all with these even using them with a hat on. I hope Bose can get the app worked out for the iPhone users it’d be a shame for them to miss out on a great set of ANC headphones.',\n",

These improve on the noise cancelling (which is mainly what I want for long flights, even without music). The Bose app and pairing is clunky, and it took a while to get these working correctly. The minimal instructions are not helpful. But once paired they worked flawlessly. Sound quality is always a matter of taste and impossible to review. I would say these are very neutral sounding headphones. Many have complained of the larger case and the fact that they do not fold up. Honestly, that is exactly why I do like them. You just lay them in the case and you are done. I used to struggle trying to fold up my other ones while landing. They really are not that much larger. The closing cord compartment in the case is a good idea but could be larger. I do wish all the manufacturers had not gone to dedicated rechargeable batteries. It is so much easier to carry AAA's for a quick change. I am still happy I made the upgrade. The jury is still out on durability. Only time will tell.\",\n",

The problem with the gaming headsets I had was lack of noise cancellation, which was especially pronounced when my loud AC unit was running 5 feet away. The Bose 700 cuts out all the noise for the caller who normally complains about it. The most amazing surprise was how much benefit I'm getting from less noise. At level 10 NC, I literally cannot hear the loud AC unit. It is like magic because I do not understand how it works, but it does. Very cool technology. The app works fine, so does Google assistant.

No these don't have thumping bass, but just enough bass so it doesn't cover up vocals. Vocals are very clear. I'm giving it 5 stars because it was advertised this way.

Comes with a really nice case, and charges via usb-c so I can use my phone charger for both if needed. Has same Bose sound as QCs, maybe a little cleaner if anything but it's hard to improve that perfect sound. Bass as with Bose is not booming compared to bass heavy cups like the Beats or Sonys. Built quality is sturdy, and the band isn't that cushion like the QCs, so it won't wear or rip over time. I wouldn't run or workout in these as they are comfortable for a walking commute or something like that but due to the tension from the band if you knock one side with your arm or whip your head they will spring off. That isn't easy to do so don't think it happens easy or often just when I'm laying in bed and turn my head on a pillow is an example. Are they better than the QCs? I would say yes. The battery literally lasts how long the voice prompt tells you when you press the lower button, which is really nice. I get a day or two easy, then charging doesn't take long at all. I hope I covered everything, but if you like the QCs you will love these plain and simple.\",\n",

I’ve tried many different headsets, earbuds, etc. and none performed well enough to allow me to keep them on while on a call. Sometimes these calls can last many hours while troubleshooting an issue. This has impacted my hearing a great deal, but I shied away from the price of the Bose headsets due to the price to some degree, but mostly because I never saw a review that confirmed that a phone conversation is possible in these crazy loud environments. Well I finally saw a review where a guy compared these to the Sony top end NC headphones and you could hear him talk on a phone call in a loud room with the Bose, and the Sony’s you could not. All you could do was tell he was speaking. This is a deal breaker for me so I went with Bose. These have literally changed my life! I can effortlessly use both my phones at the same time (work and personal) so I can listen to my music, and take a work call, then back to music. People never complain they can’t hear me.\\nIf you have the same needs I would say buy these things. If you don’t need to be on calls in loud places, and mainly want music performance, the Sonys may suit you better, but here’s another thing; that may be age-dependant. I’m 61 and have lost a lot of my high frequency hearing from working in data centers for 40 years. I don’t need massive base, I need help with the highs and that’s what I’ve heard some people complain that the Bose are too “bright”.

These headphones deliver high quality, balanced sound for my middle-aged ears, offer great connectivity and batteries hold their charge (20 hours). Connectivity is streamlined and quick with all my devices. I do not need to be connected to wi-fi for them to function; initially connecting via the Bose app was easy I was able to set them up quickly and Bose customer service was very quick to respond to a question I had during set-up. While I no longer use the Bose app, it was good to get them registered directly with Bose. The noise cancelling option offers 2 different levels (5 and 10)... 10 is amazing cancelling the majority of low-level, bass sounds in the environment. Sometimes I put on my favorite light music or nature sounds, close my eyes and give myself a break from everything. It's like being able to take a mini-vacation from everyday life.

It also has excellent battery life (about 20 hours) and also tells you how many hours are left rather than battery percentage which is nice. My 3 star rating is because I think the Bose “music” app is terrible. The 35 works with a Bose + app that allows you to add numerous radio stations (cnn npr etc) as well as music stations which you tap to play through the headphones. These are all apps you probably can add to your phone but it is great to have them in one place. The 700 Bose app has nothing other than the ability to set your favorite noise canceling level and a battery gauge. It is really inferior unless I am missing something. I actually use the Bose + with the 700’s to get the music and radio features since the Music app basically sucks. That is my reason for 3 stars. Also they are really expensive at $400.

Unfortunately the first pair I had began running static through the left earpiece. That pair also just kind of just shut down on me. They were open and the light indicated that they were on, but they weren't connecting to any of my devices, which they connected well with before this issue. I had Beats customer service tell me how to factory rest them and they began to work again, but then the static in the left ear piece came back. This is when I decided to contact amazon and they gave me a new pair. I received the new headphones today. Tried to make them work and guess what, only connects to one of the two devices I was originally able to connect it to just fine. If I factory reset the new pair of headphones, they would connect to the other device and not the device I just had it connected to. As the title says, I don't know if it's just my luck, or these pair of headphones actually have some serious issues. Looks like I'm gonna need to set up an appointment at an apple store or a best buy to see what the problem is with the second pair of headphones I received from Amazon.

              "       \"I was looking for lightweight, comfortable headphones with decent sound (and WITHOUT over-hyped bass frequencies - I'm lookin' at YOU, Beats by Dre!) that wouldn't break the bank. I wanted them for the gym, and for making music on my laptop studio when I'm away from home. I didn’t need or want noise-cancelling, and these headphones don’t have it.\\n\\nIdeally I would have love to have tried them out first, but I've always had a high opinion of Audio Technica, so took a gamble on ordering them online without testing them for sound quality and comfort.\\n\\nThese headphones come with instructions and a charging cable. That's it. Packaging is solid, mostly cardboard with the seemingly unavoidable non-recyclable plastic tray. The headphones fold, and I was able to find an old soft headphone bag from a previous pair to store them in for transport. I charged them up, tucked them into my bag, and was ready to rock.\\n\\nFirst up, workout time. I happily wore them at the gym without issue - they stayed on my head, didn't get in the way, and were lightweight and comfortable. Next up, laptop time. I was waiting for a friend for a few hours yesterday, so was able to test them as tracking headphones during a nearly 4 hour Ableton Live laptop session, and they never got uncomfortable, or ran out of battery. Even my expensive studio headphones hurt my ears after 2 or 3 hours, so this was a nice revelation. I haven’t yet tried them on a phone call, but that’s not a big deal for me - who uses iPhones for TALKING any more!?\\n\\nThe controls are easy to use, and I had no issue with staying connected via Bluetooth. I haven't tested the limits of their battery life yet, but I don't imagine that will be an issue for the way I plan to use these. The headphones are indeed very comfortable, which is a huge, huge plus.\\n\\nSound quality is decent. When listening to iTunes at the gym I found that the sound was decent, but felt a little flat, without a lot of definition. Although they don't have super-hyped bass frequencies, the sound was still a bit … tubby. When tracking with Ableton on my laptop, I wasn't bothered as much by the sound quality, and felt that I was able to hear a more defined sound-field, and I felt the mids and highs were fine. But to be fair, I was making some pretty bass-heavy electronic music. Will see how it sounds on my studio speakers.\\n\\nOverall, decent, solid headphones with decent sound. Well-made and reliable.

I really appreciate that the ear padding material is pretty soft and therefor I can wear these with glasses without them feeling like they're pressed into the side of my head. My only complaint is that the size of the ear-cup is a little snug. I don't have large features, and I have to be really careful with the headband adjustment to make sure my ears don't get strained. That said, having a good seal around the ear is crucial to a good pair of CLOSED-BACK headphones. I'm definitely able to listen to music in public at lower volumes than I would on open-back headphones, so the fact that they're good for your hearing is a plus.\\n\\nI bought these as an alternative to my AKG 240s because I wanted a closed-back headphone that was easier to throw in my backpack, and these have accomplished that.

They fold neatly and easily fit into my small backpack when I want to stow them.\\n\\nThe audio quality is good, though not astounding, and they don't block out all noise, but it's enough to block out the noise on the daily bus ride.

I looked at Bose QC35 (very comfortable, excellent noise cancelling, but way too expensive), JBL Everest Elite 700 (not as expensive, ok noise cancelling, very comfortable but bulky looking), and then these little gems. I honestly thought this brand was something you'd find only in closeouts or less well known retail establishments and never really gave them a second thought. I always considered it an off brand, to be honest. BUT.....I decided to take a chance on them, thinking for this price point, I can't lose, right?\\nI got these and put them on after charging and wow. I'm impressed! Sound is pretty nice, noise cancelling is awesome. In fact, I think it's comparable to the higher priced headphones I was considering before. I really don't need a set of headphones that will cancel out every utterance of daily life, just the majority of ambient noise will make me happy. But honestly, I find that they fit so well around my ears that I really don't need to use the noise cancelling feature that much. Just the fit makes it noise cancelling. The bluetooth connection is quick and there is an included audio cable for when you might run out of battery. These reportedly get 30 hours of battery life on playback, but I have yet to test that out. If this is the case, then these headphones are far superior (IMHO) to the higher priced headphones that have less battery life. Plus, if the rechargeable battery dies on these, then I'm not going to be as concerned with buying another set as I would be if I had purchased the higher priced headphones.\\nAs for looks? They look great, ear cups are soft, headband is padded, and they aren't tight on my head or my ears. Sure, maybe the metal colored plastic is a little cheap, but I'm not expecting high dollar features for this price point. And yes, maybe the button on the right to skip ahead and back is a little clicky, but I can deal with it. Oh, and yes...that clicky skip forward/back button is NOT the volume up/down you might think when you first put them on (I thought it was). Just so you know. I cannot find a way to reprogram it. That is a weird feature. On wireless headphones, I would think you'd put the volume buttons on the headphones instead of a button to skip songs. I am concerned, however, that the leatherette headband and earcups will be susceptible to tearing over time due to use, but I'm sure I can find a cover or a replacement and fix that problem straightaway.\\nOverall, I'm happy I bought these. I really bought them for travel. I have a pair of Beats Pro DJ headphones with the aluminum ear cups and they weren't cheap, so to take them on the road with me makes me nervous that they'll get messed up from going in and out of my bag all the time (in fact, that has already happened GRRRR). Granted, I don't want these to get messed up either, but if it happens then I didn't pay that much for them, and the sting will not be so bad.\",\n",

They don\\'t blow you out the water with sound, but for the price, I was pleasantly surprised. For some reason, the music seems to sound better using noise cancellation. Otherwise, I get a hollow sound. I also noticed that, after downloading an after-market equalizer for my phone and customizing the settings, It increased the sound quality immensely. The controls on the earpiece take a bit getting used to. I would have liked for the volume up to be on top and volume down to be on the bottom. Also, I haven\\'t gotten any connection issues that are common with inexpensive bluetooth headphones. I believe these are bluetooth 4.0, which isn\\'t bad. They come with a usb to micro usb cable as well as a 3.5mm audio jack cable that enables you to charge your headphones while listening. Also included is a synthetic travel bag for the headphones. I would recommend getting a hard case if you\\'re going to travel/pack these.\\nOverall, I really like these and recommend these for anyone looking for decent sounding, comfortable and inexpensive blue tooth headphones. I would say these give other better known brand, $100+ headphones a run for their money.',\n",
              "       'I want to state that I think, for the price, these are perfectly good headphones. I realize that in not paying a premium, I should not expect premium performance. And so overall, I am happy with this purchase. But these headphones are not going to allow you to flip a switch and block out the noise in a coffee shop or other non-constant white noise. The noise cancelling in these headphones is good enough to get rid of some white noise \"hum\" in the ambient background noise, but that\\'s about it. Their other noise cancelling properties come largely from an earmuff effect - they physically block noise because they are large, over-ear headphones. What this means for me is I can put these on in a noisy coffee shop and knock the noise down enough where I don\\'t have to blast music into my brain to be able to work - which is a more pleasant way to work. But without music on, I am still in a coffee shop, listening to a dozen conversations, and having difficulty focusing. So if you want headphones that take the edge off just enough to listen to music at a reasonable volume in a crowded place, these will do just fine. If you are expecting to flip a switch and mute the world, these will not do the job.',\n",

I\\'m always looking for technological advances and improvements in playback equipment such as headphones. Based on the incredible reviews these Cowin E7\\'s received on Amazon I thought it would be advantageous for me, especially in this low price range to see what all the hype was about, so I ordered them.\\nAfter unboxing and putting these low priced headphones through a series of audio tests that I run on all my equipment testing high, midrange, and bass output; testing ambience, fidelity, spatial and pitch parameters, etc, I quickly came to the conclusion that the good reviews of Cowin\\'s E7\\'s were either fake or contrived. These cans are BASS of mostly BASS with a muddy almost monophonic output. There was absolutely no midrange audio and only slight treble. My Sony MDR-7506 Dynamic Professional Studio, corded only headphones (on Amazon at $115.99) are what I test an rate all headphones against. To my ears and experience they are as near to perfect and balanced as anything could be. These low priced Cowin E7\\'s are typical of headphones in this price range and have no measurable fidelity; and the noise cancelling is also very poor, but then when it comes to audio equipment and my years of experience I can state \"you always get what you pay for\" and I didn\\'t pay much so I did not expect much and I did not get much. Mr. Cowin, you\\'ve got to know that this is a true evaluation of the E7\\'s and I don\\'t quite understand why so many, if even real, evaluations praise these cans online as they are not as good as portrayed on Amazon.

BUT, these had that weird compression feeling when the anc was turned on...and a bit of hiss.

It would have been nice if they just played as regular headphones when not on and then given me the option of using the noise cancelling if wanted. When using bluetooth and/or noise cancelling, you're going to get sound from these headphones but, you can't make ANY adjustments to it other than volume. The sound quality isn't bad . . . it's just that I would have liked to have a little more control of it. If that's not a factor with you, then they're pretty good headphones.\",\n",

Ear buds were almost completely useless and I started looking for a set of noise cancelling earphones as soon as I got home. I'm happy to say that these made my second trip much better. These aren't miracle earphones, I was still aware that I was on an airplane, but I was able to listen to gentile meditation and relaxation music on the plane and I only heard a slight buzzing in the background from the plane engines. When I took the headphones off the talk to the attendant, I was amazed how loud the plane cabin was outside these headphones. They cut out a good 90% of the noise.\\nThey are comfortable enough for me, and the folding feature was handy. They easily fit into my purse while going through airport security. You'll need to read the instructions to get the hang of the controls. Pretty much, you just hold down the power button until it turns on and pairs, and hold it again to turn off. I can't speak to the phone features, I'm only interested in using these as traditional headphones.\\nIf you have an upcoming flight and are considering headphones, I can highly recommend these. If you want to spend $200 for some super duper headphones then go for it, but if you want something sturdy, affordable, and of good quality then these are great.\",\n",

Take them off every hour or so, so your ears can breathe though. . The ONLY issue I\\'ve had, and it\\'s not the fault of the Mpow people is that when I run iTunes on my Win10 PC it gets way confused and I have to turn Bluetooth off, exit iTunes, then turn Bluetooth back on and restart iTunes.

They work very well to block out the loud engine noise and create a wonderful listening experience. I often listen to audiobook which are very easy to hear in a loud environment. These headphones have a rich and deep sound for music. As good as Beats, to me. A very long battery cycle is nice. I charge mine maybe once a week if even that. And that's listening for a couple hours at work, then 2-4 in the evenings. They adjust well and fit nicely. They don't feel cheap. To be honest the Thor model feels cheap and doesn't compare. On these, the controls are very nice and easy to use. The range is astonishing. I walk to the printer and forget to take my phone.

Almost a year later, I'm still using these EVERY DAY, and they sound great! I'm not really sure if the noise cancelling even works...I think most if from the isolation of the over-the-ear cushions, but the result is good for me.

I didn’t leave them on for an extended period and I’d wear them for an hour or two and then take a rest from use for at least as long... and they still hurt and wearing them led to headaches. I’m petite but I don’t think that is a factor... I think the issue is in the plastic band that runs along the top of the head. The band is not flat but has an edge (like a C or L shape) and the comfort memory foam type cushion is located beneath that with the vinyl covering wrapping that edge so that edge coupled with the weight makes the cushion nonexistent. I had an indentation from that ridge on my scalp that took 2 days to go away and was headachy all the while. I tried wrapping extra cushion but then the cups were off. So while I can’t wear them as intended, moving around while working on projects, I have found them beneficial after pairing them with my tv which allows me to watch without worry of keeping others up... if I’m laying down so the weight isn’t pulling down on the top of my head, then they are perfectly comfortable. I should say I’ve never been a fan of headbands or sunglasses so I’m not accustomed to a band across my scalp so I might be more sensitive than others- I’m not sure, but these are not for you if band comfort is a concern. Totally happy with the electronic function and sound but these aren’t a fit for me due to comfort. I have the MPOW flame as well and those are great but i was looking to increase playing time and avoid the band under the chin or across the back of the neck, as that is a bit of a hassle if your working up a sweat and they will get pulled out of one ear when the band gets stuck. I have total confidence in the electronic and sound quality of this brand, which is telling because I’ve run through quite a few brands trying to find headphones with decent sound quality that hold up to high activity while wearing and these have been the only ones that have survived that test so now I just need to find the model that’s my comfort fit.',\n",

They look even better in person than the photos. I got the green and black ones and the green is bright without looking like a kids toy. The weight is slightly more heavy than I'd want, but considering how well they fit and comfortable they are (I've worn then for hrs now) it's a fair trade off. Also they can be very loud. I usually have my volume at 75 or max but these are so good that I only need to put them at 50% and they are plenty loud. Can't hear my kids sitting next to me at all and they tell me I'm yelling! One con is that they do bleed noise if you have them at 50% or higher. Not an issue for the listener, but good to note in case you plan to use these in the bedroom or office. People around you can't really hear them if they're 40% or less though so it's no big deal for me. I started to buy on or over ear headphones after noticing hearing loss after years of earbuds so having a device that does not require me to put it above 50% volume is pretty great.

Also, the foam on the right side seems to have indents. Hoping these will puff up over time. Since there is a 2 year warranty I'm not too worried about it right now. I just hope the seller will honor it. I recommend these though for people who use it sparingly or for kids who tend to misplace things. Losing these won't hurt as much as losing a pair of beats.

If you have the volume a little louder, but still comfortable, you can drain out some of the noise around you; however, you can still hear the noise.

The sounds is balanced and clear. I mostly use them for the gym and they fit well over my ears and stay on even as I love about and sweat.\\nIt was after a few weeks of continuous use that I noticed the max volume started to decrease and they weren't able to cancel out the gym noises as well as before. Also, sometimes they would randomly disconnect from the bluetooth on my laptop. Thankfully, I was able to stop my music in time before it came blaring out of the speakers. Finally, they didn't hold charge as well as they did before. It's not a drastic change but because I use them for a specific amount of time each day, it was obvious to me.\\nI recommended these headphones to someone who purchased them and I hope they don't encounter the same issue.\\nBesides these issues, I do still like them and use them on a daily basis.\",\n",

The connectivity is great, no issues there. The only super negative review would be the dirty lining appearing on both ears(showed on pictures I attached) As you notice on both pictures, they’re different colors. I thought it was a dirt on the outside of the plastic casing (though I don’t sleep on it) but I tried wiping it off and no it doesn’t budge. It doesn’t smell either so it is something internal.

I find myself having to adjust them on my head frequently because it starts to get painful over my ears or across the top.

              "       \"I HATE earbuds. They are either very uncomfortable , make my ears ITCH or both. So I decided to go with over ears headphones. I bought a 70.00 pair..Thinking they would be PERFFECT. They broke on my third time wearing them. So, I went with a 30.00 pair...The build and sound quality was laughable; they were sent back. When I opened up my PowerLocus headphones I was kinda shocked. They have this buttery soft coating and they are beautiful( I know sounds stupid but they really are) I purchased the black and white pair. I LOVE them. I wear them when I listen to Audible, when I'm talking in the phone, when I walk to the store. I wear them when I vaccume or clean the house. I live in an Apartment and I don't listen to anything very loud as not to disturb my upstairs neighbor. I love that they tell you they are paired. They charge very quickly. The charge lasts a total of 10.5 hours. They come with a cord in case you don't have a way to charge but still want to listen. They also came with a beautiful and also buttery soft storage case, that is hard so your headphones will not be broken in dropped or squished if accidentally sat upon. All in all they are wonderful. Oh and the noise cancellation is great. I vaccume with them on and have no problem hearing my book. They have super soft padding and fit my ears very comfortably.

I'm not disappointed at all that I bought these. I bought them mainly as a replacement for the in-ear headphones I had been using while working out. They were fine, but having them wired and needing my phone in my pocket to listen to music quickly became annoying. The screen kept unlocking and selecting things I dd not want from the friction in the pocket. Not cool for working out and staying focused!\\nWell enter these headphones. Admittedly I was a bit skeptical at first. I didn't think the price was high enough for something like this. That was put to rest after my first use.\\nThe only negative I can say right away is the battery life seems to drain a bit faster than I expected. It isn't too fast that the whole thing isn't usable. Maybe my expectation was a bit high. Other than that these headphones are great for the price and what I want to use them for.\\nThey block out outside noise really well. I do have to turn up the volume each time to get it to where I want it, but that isn't a negative. The control buttons could maybe be a little more prominent and separated a little further apart, but I don't have a problem using them to adjust volume.\\nThe Bluetooth pairing is super easy, just turn the headphones on and then enable Bluetooth on whatever device you want to connect to. Simple. The instructions even give you the default code to connect in case you are asked for a password!\\nThe sound quality is great to. I'll even say it's better than what I was using before. All sorts of different types of music sound fantastic. The headphones themselves are very comfortable and not too heavy. They feel really nice sitting on my ears. The folding function is easy to do, though I worry about breaking them. That isn't a knock on the build quality, but more a worry about myself not being aware at a given time that I shouldn't be rough with them.\\nTo wrap it all up, yes you should buy these. They're a great product and the value you receive is high. There are lots of color variations to suit your own personality. So what are you waiting for? Pick a pair up and enjoy!\",\n",

The sound is really good and unlike the other Bluetooth headphones I have had before they did not drop signal 5 ft away. i can walk away from my phone or computer about 30 ft before I start having any problems which to me is really good. the hard case is one of my favorite things. I carry a backpack with e everywhere with bottles of water and just about everything else in there so it keeps them protected. As far as road noise and screaming children these really help block out alot of that and they are comfortable and yet snug enough that when I am riding even on rough terrain they do not come off of my head. The mic seems to be pretty clear when I have used it to make calls. I cannot say much for the FM radio given we have no stations for about 60 miles I assume this is why I do not get channels. The SD reader works well. So far so good, I really like them. I have used them quite a bit for watching movies, YouTube, or listening via Bluetooth and SD and so far I am just down to 50 percent battery and they have been used alot intermittently. I am not sure how long it would last constantly using them like watching a trilogy movie set or something but I am pretty sure it would be a few hours. I have yet to be able to run them dead it seems that would take a very long time. If I ever decide to do that I will update this. It comes with a charging cable a hard case, the headphones and a 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapter so you can plug it directly into a device and not have to use Bluetooth. I am really pleasantly surprised.

It was also impressive being able to tune in FM radio stations with just a few clicks, and the reception was adequate, but not without some static.

For this price point ($69.99 price I paid), you shouldn't compare with $250-$350+ major brands but I would strongly try these as strong contender and pocket extra savings.

The earcups can swivel so that it can rest comfortably on your chest while on your neck when not being used.\\n\\nI tested these headphones with the Ultimate Headphones (and Earphones) Test which you can find on the AudioCheck's website. I was able to hear the frequencies from 20Hz-15kHz clearly, without any distortion or leveling issues. The left and right drivers are matched up perfectly. The built-in microphone worked well and the other person could hear my voice clearly throughout the whole call.\\n\\nI didn't experience any problems with pairing and playing sound through the Bluetooth headphones when connected to my iPhone, Android tablet, and Macbook. There was a slight delay when watching videos and then hearing the corresponding sound, but it wasn't a deal breaker since I listen to music most of the time. You can offset the audio so that the video and audio track are synced up.\\n\\nThe range on the Bluetooth was the part that actually surprised me, I could listen to music clearly and loudly while still being 40 feet away from my phone. I was even able to leave my phone on the 2nd level of my house and listen to music while moving around on the 1st level. The sound quality while on Bluetooth was about the same as when plugged into the audio cable; the loudness was about 1db louder when plugged in.\\n\\nWhen turning on the active noise canceling in a quiet environment, you can hear a little bit of white noise which is to be expected. I tried the active noise canceling while playing music from another speaker, running the vacuum cleaner, and having someone talk to me.\\n\\nThe active noise canceling worked really well blocking out the lower frequencies, you can still hear the higher frequencies but it is quieter. It works even better when you have some music playing through the headphones with active noise canceling on; I couldn't even hear that someone was talking to me or the music playing from the other speaker.\\n\\nThese headphones only took 48 minutes to charge from empty to full.

              "       'Another update after some long flights September 2019:\\nThe only noise canceling earphones I have ever used on a plane have been earbuds that made a tight seal inside the ear and closed off all other sound . These headphones make a nice seal on your ear and they are very comfortable but they do not block out sound altogether they just change it . I listened to several hours of an audible book forgetting to turn the noise canceling button on . I could hear the book just fine but realized after a few hours that I was of course hearing the drone of the airplane motor. When I switched the noise canceling button to on it changes the sound from a low rumble to a higher pitched noise but once your music or audible begins you don’t really hear that noise anymore . But I think it also takes the bass out of whatever you’re listening to which doesn’t really matter if it’s just somebody reading a book . I don’t know how it would be for music . You can still hear the airline announcements and sort of hear the attendant talking softly to you offering snacks which I suppose is a good thing but I was used to more noise canceling than these provide. I still recommend them however .\\n\\nUpdate to below. To turn these on or off you need to push and hold the power button for five-seven seconds. After posting my lower star original review I received a lovely response from the seller offering several generous solutions to my problem of not being able to turn off the headphones properly. But actually it was my problem, not theirs. Thus, now I give five stars. I leave my original ( below) only for reference. However, I do have another comment. These headphones do what they are probably supposed to do which is to make motor noise and other loud noises dull. But they don’t cancel out everything. You can hear water running, voices, and other sounds. You are not in a soundproof chamber. On the plus side the sound from the phone comes through loud and clear with no hiccups. And you can set your device down and walk a distance away- in my case I could walk outside and leave the phone in the house.\\n\\nOriginal review: “I feel totally dumb. I can’t turn these off! I push the power button and see the light that pairs with my phone. So far so good. I listen to Audible on my phone through the headphones. Good still. I finish listening and shut down audible. I shut down the phone. I push the power button to turn off the headphones. Or so I imagine. I take the phone upstairs. The next morning I wake up my phone but it has no sound because it’s all automatically diverted to the headphones, which are on a whole different floor of my house. How do I turn them off without shutting off Bluetooth on my phone?”',\n",
              "       'I purchased these headphones initially for a transatlantic flight - let’s start there. I flew from Los Angeles to New York and then abroad to Prague, being that I’m a nervous traveler to begin with I thought of the different ways I could make traveling 18 + hours more comfortable...over the ear noise canceling headphones were a must on my list. I worried that due to the length of travel I’d be near restless babies or chatty passengers plus I hoped to sleep. These headphones did their job beautifully. I put them on before takeoff and was asleep before we even left the runway. For both legs of my trip I slept without noise disturbance AT ALL. I did not hear the chatter of passengers, I have no clue if there were upset children and I didn’t hear any of the announcements over the speakers. Plus I was listening to audiobooks not music - the noise cancellation feature worked very well for books and movies and better with music. The over ear comfort was great! I slept with a neck pillow and there was no head or ear soreness. I do have a tiny head so a concern was that the noise cancellation wouldn’t be as effective as it would with someone with a more normal sized noggin, however I had no issue with the fit or noise seeping in. The charge held for both flights, my layover, my wait through customs and my ride to my apartment in the city which all said and done was nearly 23 hours of use. I’ve continued to use them at work rather than the in-ear AirPods, the comfort of these far surpasses that of my previous option. These were a great buy and I highly recommend for anyone searching.',\n",
              "       'I do a lot of writing while listening to music at a very busy (and, therefore, noisy) coffee shop. I\\'ve been searching far and wide for headphones or earbuds that will decrease the noise and, therefore, allow me to listen to music at a much lower volume (so that I\\'m not using the volume to drown out noise). But, as a former professional musician, I\\'m very picky about sound quality.\\nI have recently tried a range of products, including highly rated Bose earbuds with Comply \"noise cancelling\" tips, all of which disappointed me. Thankfully, Amazon has been great with the returns, although they are probably about ready to cancel my account.\\nBut I\\'m finally satisfied! I was, frankly, amazed by these the first time I put them on in the coffee shop. First, even without any music playing or noise-cancellation, these provide a great deal of noise isolation; the phones cover your ears and are tight, but comfortable, and seal the ear off from a lot of noise.\\nThen, I switched on the noise-cancellation. WOW! The music playing in the coffee shop nearly disappeared! Better than that, it cancelled out a range of low frequency noise, from the bass in the shop\\'s music to the hum of machines and people chatting.\\nAs for the sound, without the noise cancellation (just the physical isolation), the phones sounds quite good, good enough for this very picky, former musician. The frequency response is excellent at both the low and high ends. Using the noise-cancellation, however, adds a LOT of mid-range to the sound, so that the phones sound very \"honky.\" Since I use a graphic equalizer, I could easily drop out some mids, making these sounds excellent, even while using the noise cancellation (I use the free Equalizer APO on my laptop and Spotify\\'s EQ on their phone app).\\nSo, I couldn\\'t be happier with this purchase. I\\'m listening to crystal clear music at a low volume that still sounds loud because it\\'s not competing with all the noise around me.\\nSo, while these are not perfect, for the price they easily deserve five stars.\\nBy the way, these appear to be identical to the TaoTronics Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, which have the same description and dimensions and are usually priced the same as the Boltune. The Boltune headphones are manufactured by Shenzhen Nearby Express Technology Development Co, which is owned by SunValley Group, which also owns TaoTronics and Hoo-Too, the seller of the Boltune phones.',\n",

Out of the box, everything that I need was there. I charged it through the micro USB port. The unit came with a traveling case which is convenient. I own a pair of Bose QuiteComfort, and the size of the case is about the same.\\n(2) Pairing with the sound source is a breeze. I paired it with my mobile phone, and also paired it with my TV. Both worked fine. I will check out the wired connection later.\\n(3) Over two weeks, I used the headphone on and off to listen to different music. The battery in the headphone was good and held power well. I don't run into issue of unexpected power outage.\\n(4) The sound quality at all range is clear and the bass is deep. Stereo separation is also good. I paired it with my TV so I can listen to it without affecting other people in the house. I don't have a chance to check out the noise cancellation in air travel, but I tested it at home against a running pool motor. The effect was obvious and I would expect the same during a flight. At this price point, having noise cancellation is a great plus.\\n(5) I used it in listening for less than 2 hours usually. As with all over-the-ear headphone, if you wear it for longer period, the weight of the headphone is going to get to you. The headphone is pretty comfortable all around.\\n(6) (Versatility) I just tried the optional wired connection from headset to my cellphone. Wow, the sound is good! You don't need to turn on the power on the headset to hear the sound. This is a great backup in case the headset runs out of battery.\\nOverall, I think this is an excellent product at the price point. Having a nice bluetooth headphone is a great plus to enjoy music everywhere!\",\n",

They charge really fast as well. The sound quality is amazing as well. I really suggest you take a look at these. The build quality is really excellent as well.\",\n",
              "       'Edit the seconding: I was able to get in contact with Sony. They replaced the headset within a week and the second pair works perfectly. The call quality issues were fixed and they perform just as well in all other regards. I am going to adjust my rating from 3 to 5 stars.\\n\\nEdit: I have found that this issue is not repeatable when calling through Skype or Whatsapp. When using the built in phone dialer for IOS and Android the issue with the hallway/echo occurs. When using a VOIP service the calls come through crystal clear on both ends.\\n\\nI received my headphones yesterday and I have been very impressed. The sound quality and noise cancellation is very well done. There is just one issue from making them great. It is impossible to make a phone call through them. It sounds like I am down a hallway when talking. I have been told that the person on the other end could hear an echo of themselves better than the they can hear me. So far the tagline seems to be right \"Only Music. Nothing Else\".',\n",
              "       \"Purchased and used for two days before returning. Problems included poor sound quality (distortions even at low volume, fuzzy, hollow, even after tuning with the app), inability to maintain Bluetooth connection from more than a couple feet away from source, would lose Bluetooth connections if I turned my head (tried with multiple sources and distances), and people I spoke with using the mic said they were getting echoes from me and that I sounded far away. Also, the plastic construction while light/comfortable reeks of cheapness and seems fragile. The leatherette covering the foam ear muffs is liquid-thin and pitifully cheap; was already showing slight cracks out of the box.\\n\\nWith respect to the poor sound quality and connection problems, I probably got a defective unit, but the production quality proved so poor I wouldn't try them again at even half the price.\",\n",
              "       'The noise canceling on these is noticeably improved over the previous generation. The sound quality is excellent, and if you use the Headphones app you can change the base and other EQ settings. The base is good and strong, especially when you turn it up. When you enable noise canceling and run the optimizer, it is phenomenal! Voices are not completely canceled, but in most cases they will be muffled and hard to understand. Play music on top of noise canceling, and you won’t really hear anything at all. I attempted to use these in the dining room which was very loud, and I would say about 90% of the sound was canceled out without playing any music. I’m not sure how these will handle in the car, but I suspect they should be fine. Wind noise might be the only issue, which isn’t that big of a deal. They are extremely comfortable as well. Maybe not quite as good as the QC 35 headphones, but very close. They are a clear step up from last year‘s noise canceling headphones!\\nUpdate.\\nThe headband is covered in leather and has more Patty. I have not heard of any cracking issues, and the headband feels slightly stronger to me. Also, the swivel pointst feel stronger as well.',\n",
              "       \"I own the 1000XM2's. Sony said these would be lighter and they are. They said they would sound better, and they sound twice as good, especially after setting your custom EQ settings in the app. They said the noise canceling would be better and it is. They said they would be more comfortable, and due to larger ear cups (and the lighter weight), they are. They said they would look better, and the narrower profile does make them look better. They did all of this without sacrificing the quality of the construction (I sleep with these on, rolling right over onto my pillow at night).\\n\\nFor me, the much-improved sound quality of music is the most dramatic improvement and the most unexpected, although all the improvements add up to make these vastly improved over the XM2's.\",\n",
              "       'After going back an forth between the 1000XM2 and the Bose QC35II, ended up buying the Sony and it was awesome..... Until a few days later when they released the 1000XM3!!! I quickly turned the XM2 and bought these. They made a substancial improvement over something awesome! Slight improve on sound quality, BIG improvement on noise cancelling and a great job redesigning everything! They look a lot nicer (even though this is personal opinion) on my head. I would also note that they are very comfortable.',\n",

              "       'I had to have the first pair replaced by amazon due to a constant rattle in the left ear speaker. The replacement pair had a loud pop that occured any time I moved my head or placed the headphones on. I do not recommend these to anyone. My experience was bad and I really did not enjoy my purchase or experience with amazon support. The battery life lives up to what it claims but the build material issues left me not ever wanting to buy sony noise cancelling headphones.',\n",

              "       'Sony WH1000XM3 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Over Ear Headphones, Silver (WH-1000XM3/S)I was the proud owner of the Sony WH1000M2 for 2 weeks. I did like them a lot. Very good sound, excellent noise cancellation, but not the most comfortable. I started to watch a lot of reviews of the WH1000Ms on youtube and decided to exchange my M2 for the M3. Yes!! Wow! Super comfortable! Even better Noice Cancellation. But the sound quality? In my opinion a very big upgrade! Fantastic sound quality! Much better than the M2. Maybe just a tad bass heavy, but I adjust that on my Galaxy S9+ equalizer. When you connect with the Sony LDAC lossless codec, you are not able to use the Sony apps build in equalizer. I prefer to use LDAC instead of the standard SBC codec since it is totally uncompressed. I listen a lot to classical music, and in my opinion, the M3 offers for me at least, a very very decent soundstage! I could not be more impressed. Best headphones I have ever had! Big upgrade from the M2!',\n",
              "       \"You can pair it with multiple devices, but you cannot switch devices! Unbelievable! As Sony says, the only way is to switch off bluetooth on other devices. So, in my my case it will just connect to my iPad, even if I'm not using it. To switch it to my iPhone I have to find my iPad, switch off bluetooth, and then connect again from my iPhone. Crazy.\\n\\nI'm seriously considering returning this. What good is sound quality if you cannot connect to the sound source?\",\n",
              "       \"These are my first pair of noise cancelling headphones, I have started travelling more and needed something to keep my sanity. Within the 1st eight days of ownership, I used them for over 60 hours on two charges, the battery life is exactly as advertised. The comfort is outstanding, I wear glasses and this pair of headphones accommodates them perfectly. I had four very long flights and Sony's adaptive noise cancelling system works like a dream, with music or movies playing, all background noise, including the plane turbines, disappeared. The build quality is high. These are a premium set of headphones and worth every penny.\",\n",
              "       'Once you get it hooked to music or an app or game and HAVE sound(doing that is the tough part) you will like the quality. There are a lot of problems that need to be addressed though. Pairing went okay, but if you have two device(I have an iPad and iPhone) to switch between them you have to turn the blue tooth off on the device you don\\'t want sound. Bose connection to two device is simple and you don\\'t have to turn off blue tooth... just turn off the screen. The Google assistant app messes things up a bit too as it adds another bluetooth device. I got it going but then I wanted to watch football on the iPad so switched off bluetooth and things were messed up when I tried to use a second time. Decided the assistant was not worth the hassle until Sony catches up with Bose with such things. I\\'m still deciding whether to return the headphones or not. I do like the sound!!! It\\'s better than Bose. Perhaps a firmware adjustment from Sony will help. The app is \"meh\" Maybe I should wait for a WH-1500M4 or something ;)',\n",
              "       'I\\'ve only had this headset for a day so take this with a grain of salt but these are by far the most comfortable and best sounding headphones I\\'ve ever worn. Thank the sony gods for that because its not a cheap investment for most people. The bass is kicking, most audio is loud and in your face even on streaming sources like Youtube and Netflix. There\\'s a slight delay between the audio and whats happening on screen but its really minimal most people won\\'t be bothered. I can\\'t really say anything bad about it I\\'m watching \"Bumping Mics\" in bed on Netflix and its super immersive and (hilarious) working great. Only thing I will mention that is a known issue with this headphone is that the headphones can become almost unusable in Cold temperatures without a wired connection. If the weather is below freezing 32F the Touch Pad on the ear cup won\\'t work and it can even cause malfunctioning. So people who live in really cold climates this may not be the right headphone choice for you if you plan on using them outside. Well thats it 4 out of 5 I would give a 5 if they improved the build quality a little bit and fixed the malfunctioning in cold weather, Enjoy!!!'],\n",
